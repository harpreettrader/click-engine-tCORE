| `Core`           | ClickEngine core library, containing common tools to implement the IDE and work with ClickEngine games. |
| `GDJS`           | The game engine, written in TypeScript, using PixiJS (WebGL), powering all ClickEngine games.           |
| `ClickEngine.js` | Bindings of `Core`, `GDJS` and `Extensions` to JavaScript (with WebAssembly), used by the IDE.          |
| `newIDE`         | The game editor, written in JavaScript with React, Electron and PixiJS.                                 |
| `Extensions`     | Extensions for the game engine, providing objects, behaviors, events and new features.                  |
